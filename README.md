# ImageProcessing
 Work done for image processing assignment

Image enhancement using adaptive histogram equalisation and contrast stretching
Edge detection using Prewitt, Sobel, Canny and Laplacian methods
Otsu thresholding performed on blood cell images along with morphological operations
Basic segmentation uses circular Hough transformations to identify blood cells based on roundness
Robust segmentation using active contour snake model and two stage Hough transform
